We need to divide the total number of gift bags by the number of bags he can make per day.\n\nFirst, we set up the division:\n\\[ 519 \\div 42 \\]\n\nTo perform the division, we can use long division. We start by seeing how many times 42 can go into 519. We can estimate by looking at the first two digits of 519, which is 51. Since 42 goes into 51 once (because \\(42 \\times 1 = 42\\)), we write 1 above the division line.\n\nNext, we subtract 42 from 51:\n\\[ 51 - 42 = 9 \\]\n\nNow, we bring down the next digit, which is 9, making it 99. We then see how many times 42 can go into 99. It goes in twice (because \\(42 \\times 2 = 84\\)), so we write 2 next to the 1 above the division line.\n\nNext, we subtract 84 from 99:\n\\[ 99 - 84 = 15 \\]\n\nSince 15 is less than 42, we stop here. The quotient is 12, and the remainder is 15.
