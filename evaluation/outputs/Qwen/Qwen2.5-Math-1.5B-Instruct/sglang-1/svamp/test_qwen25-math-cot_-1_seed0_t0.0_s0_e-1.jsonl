Since the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar, the amount of sugar she still needs to add is \\( 13 - y \\) cups, where \\( y \\) is the amount of sugar she has already added.

Find the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards Nell has.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff. Initially, Nell had 246 baseball cards. After giving some to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards. However, this number seems incorrect because she cannot have more baseball cards than she initially had. Let's assume there was a typo and she actually has 246 - x baseball cards left, where x is the number of baseball cards she gave to Jeff. But since the problem states she has 404 baseball cards left, we will assume the problem meant she had 246 + x baseball cards initially and now has 404 left. This means she must have received more cards than she initially had, which is not typical, but we will proceed with the given numbers.\n\nNext, let's find out how many Ace cards Nell gave to Jeff. Initially, Nell had 214 Ace cards. After giving some to Jeff, she has 495 Ace cards. Again, this number seems incorrect because she cannot have more Ace cards than she initially had.
