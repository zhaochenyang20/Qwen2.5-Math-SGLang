Let the least element of \\( B \\) be \\( k \\). Then \\( B \\) must have exactly \\( k \\) elements.\n2. The elements of \\( B \\) must be \\( k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, k+(k-1) = 2k-1 \\). This means \\( B \\) is a subset of \\( \\{k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2k-1\\} \\) and must include exactly \\( k \\) elements.\n3. The set \\( \\{k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2k-1\\} \\) has exactly \\( 2k-1-k+1 = k \\) elements, so there is exactly one way to choose \\( k \\) elements from this set, which is the set itself.\n\nNow, we need to determine the possible values of \\( k \\). Since \\( k \\) is the least element of \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) must have exactly \\( k \\) elements, \\( k \\) must be an integer such that \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq 12 \\). This is because if \\( k = 13 \\), then \\( B \\) would need to have 13 elements, but the largest element in the set \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\} \\) is 12, so it is impossible to have 13 elements.\n\nTherefore, \\( k \\) can be any integer from 1 to 12. For each \\( k \\), there is exactly one subset \\( B \\) that satisfies the condition. Thus, there are 12 such subsets.\n\nThe number of nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\} \\) that have the property that the number of elements in \\( B \\) is equal to the least element of \\( B \\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."], "pred": ["12"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
