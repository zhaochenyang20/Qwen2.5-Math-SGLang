Simplify the denominator \\((2 + i)(2 - i)\\):\n   - This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified as \\((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\\).\n   - Here, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = i\\), so \\((2 + i)(2 - i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\\).\n\nNow, we have the simplified expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{5 - 5i}{5}\n\\]\n\n3.

Let's denote the light bulbs as \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_9\\) arranged in a circle. Each bulb can be either blue or red, and the color of each bulb is determined independently with equal probability.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible colorings of the light bulbs. Since each bulb can be either blue or red, there are \\(2^9 = 512\\) possible colorings.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable colorings where each bulb is the same color as at least one of its two adjacent bulbs. We will use complementary counting to find the number of colorings where at least one bulb is not the same color as either of its adjacent bulbs.\n\nConsider a coloring where a bulb \\(B_i\\) is not the same color as either of its adjacent bulbs \\(B_{i-1}\\) and \\(B_{i+1}\\). This means that \\(B_i\\) must be different from both \\(B_{i-1}\\) and \\(B_{i+1}\\). If we fix the color of \\(B_i\\), then \\(B_{i-1}\\) and \\(B_{i+1}\\) must be the same color as \\(B_i\\).

There are two such patterns: one where the bulbs in positions 1, 4, 7 are blue and the others are red, and one where the bulbs in positions 1, 4, 7 are red and the others are blue.\n\nThus, there are exactly 2 colorings where no bulb is the same color as either of its adjacent bulbs. Therefore, the number of colorings where each bulb is the same color as at least one of its adjacent bulbs is \\(512 - 2 = 510\\).\n\nThe probability that each bulb is the same color as at least one of its adjacent bulbs is therefore \\(\\frac{510}{512} = \\frac{255}{256}\\).

Solving for \\( a \\), we get:\n\\[ a = \\frac{24 - s}{2} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the pyramid. The height of the pyramid is the perpendicular distance from the center of the square base to the apex of the pyramid. To find this height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of the base sides, and the slant height of the pyramid (which is the same as the length of the equal sides of the triangular face).\n\nThe distance from the center of the square base to the midpoint of one of the base sides is half the side length of the square, so it is \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\). The slant height of the pyramid is \\( a \\), and the height of the pyramid is \\( h \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\\[ a^2 = h^2 + \\left( \\frac{s}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\nSubstituting \\( a = \\frac{24 - s}{2} \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{24 - s}{2} \\right)^2 = h^2 + \\left( \\frac{s}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{(24 - s)^2}{4} = h^2 + \\frac{s^2}{4} \\]\nMultiplying through by 4 to clear the denominators, we get:\n\\[ (24 - s)^2 = 4h^2 + s^2 \\]\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\\[ 576 - 48s + s^2 = 4h^2 + s^2 \\]\nSubtracting \\( s^2 \\) from both sides, we get:\n\\[ 576 - 48s = 4h^2 \\]\nDividing through by 4, we get:\n\\[ 144 - 12s = h^2 \\]\n\\[ h^2 = 144 - 12s \\]\n\\[ h = \\sqrt{144 - 12s} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the value of \\( s \\). Since \\( s \\) is the side length of the square base and the perimeter of each triangular face is 24 cm, we can substitute \\( s = 8 \\) (since \\( s = 8 \\) satisfies the equation \\( s + 2a = 24 \\) with \\( a = 8 \\)):\n\\[ h = \\sqrt{144 - 12 \\cdot 8} = \\sqrt{144 - 96} = \\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a pyramid is given by the formula:\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\nThe base area of the pyramid is \\( s^2 = 8^2 = 64 \\) cm\\(^2\\), and the height is \\( 4\\sqrt{3} \\) cm.

We need to check the digit distribution in this 8-digit number. The digits are: 2, 0, 2, 3, M, M, D, D. For each digit to appear an even number of times, each digit in the 8-digit number must appear 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 times.

The sum of the number of balls in the three bins must equal 2023, i.e., \\(a + b + c = 2023\\). Since 2023 is odd, the sum of three numbers is odd if and only if an odd number of these numbers are odd. Therefore, we need exactly one or all three of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to be odd. However, since we are looking for the case where all three are odd, we need to check if this is possible.\n\nIf \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all odd, then their sum \\(a + b + c\\) would be odd + odd + odd = odd, which is consistent with 2023 being odd. Therefore, it is possible for all three bins to contain an odd number of balls.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability. Each ball has a 50% chance of going into any of the three bins. The probability that a specific ball goes into a specific bin is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). However, we need to consider the parity of the number of balls in each bin. The probability that a specific bin ends up with an odd number of balls is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) because the parity of the number of balls in a bin is equally likely to be odd or even.\n\nSince the events of each bin having an odd number of balls are independent, the probability that all three bins have an odd number of balls is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that each of the bins will contain an odd number of balls is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\\)."], "pred": ["\\frac{1}{8}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Each sheet is 11 inches by 5.5 inches, and there are 193 sheets per roll. If we assume the sheets are stacked in a way that minimizes the overall dimensions of the roll, we can consider the following arrangement: 193 sheets in a single layer, each sheet being 11 inches by 5.5 inches. This gives us a roll that is 11 inches by 193 * 5.5 inches. However, since the rolls are cylindrical with a diameter of 6 inches, we need to consider the packing of these cylindrical sheets.\n\nThe diameter of each roll is 6 inches, so we can fit approximately 6/5.5 ≈ 1.1 rolls along the width (5.5 inches) and 6/11 ≈ 0.55 rolls along the height (11 inches). Since we can't have a fraction of a roll, we need to consider the practical packing. For simplicity, let's assume we can fit 2 rolls along the width and 2 rolls along the height, which gives us a total of 4 rolls per layer. Since we have 193 sheets, we need 193/4 ≈ 48.25 layers, so we round up to 49 layers. This gives us a roll that is 6 inches in diameter and 49 * 5.5 = 269.5 inches in height.\n\nNow, we need to pack 6 such rolls in a box. The most efficient way to pack 6 cylindrical rolls is to arrange them in a 2x3 grid. The width of the box will be 2 * 6 = 12 inches, and the height of the box will be 3 * 5.5 = 16.5 inches. However, we need to consider the height of the rolls as well. Since the rolls are stacked on top of each other, the height of the box will be 6 * 11 = 66 inches.\n\nTherefore, the interior dimensions of the box are 12 inches by 16.5 inches by 66 inches.
