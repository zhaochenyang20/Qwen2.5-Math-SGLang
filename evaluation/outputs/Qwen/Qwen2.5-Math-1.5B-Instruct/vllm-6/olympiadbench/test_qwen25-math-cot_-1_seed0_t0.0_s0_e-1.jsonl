If $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ are pairwise distinct points in the open unit interval $(0,1)$, then some $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$.\n\n\n\nLemma 2.

Suppose, if possible, that no $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume that $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{k}<t_{k+1}=1$. Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range.

But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.

Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$.

Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal.

This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

Colour the cells of the board chess-like and notice that in each of the two triangular regions the number of black cells and the number of white cells differ by $\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on a rectangular board with \\( m \\) rows and \\( 2n \\) columns, satisfying the given conditions, we will proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Condition (iv): The bottom row of the board is completely covered by \\( n \\) dominoes.**\n\n   Since the bottom row has \\( 2n \\) cells and each domino covers 2 cells, the bottom row is covered by exactly \\( n \\) dominoes.

Let\n$$\ny=\\min \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: d \\nmid x, p \\mid f(x)\\} .\n$$\nBy the choice of $d$, we have $y>d$, and $y-d$ is a positive integer not divisible by $d$.

Then by the problem condition $p|f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p| f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$, and hence $f(x) \\equiv-f(2 x d-x) \\equiv f(y)$ $(\\bmod p)$.\n\nOn the other hand, assume that $f(x) \\equiv f(y)(\\bmod p)$. Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$.

By (2), all these $x_{i}$ 's have distinct residues modulo $d$. For the same reasons, $d \\geq p$. Hence, $d=p$.\n\nNow we prove that $f(n)=n$ by induction on $n$. If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$.

Note that all the connected components of $\\mathcal{G}$ are monochromatic and hence contain at most four edges. Thus also all circuits of $\\mathcal{G}$ are monochromatic and have length at most four.

Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not change; the only difference is that $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$ swap their positions. These arguments may be applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\n\nFor instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and $S W$-ants, moving only south and west. Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after $2 m-1$ time units.

We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$.

So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case.

We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$.

On the other hand, $\\ell, r \\leq 4$, so there are two flags with coinciding right part; let them be $L_{1} R_{1}$ and $L_{2} R_{1}\\left(L_{1} \\neq L_{2}\\right)$.\n\nNext, since $r \\geq 3$, there exist some flags $L_{3} R_{3}$ and $L_{4} R_{4}$ such that $R_{1}, R_{3}, R_{4}$ are distinct. Let $L^{\\prime} R^{\\prime}$ be the remaining flag. By (i), one of the pairs $\\left(L^{\\prime}, L_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(L^{\\prime}, L_{2}\\right)$ can form a $2 \\times 2$ square with monochrome diagonal; we can assume that $L^{\\prime}, L_{2}$ form a square with a blue diagonal. Finally, the right parts of two of the flags $L_{1} R_{1}, L_{3} R_{3}, L_{4} R_{4}$ can also form a $2 \\times 2$ square with a blue diagonal by (ii). Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$. For the induction step, assume that $N>4$, consider any $2^{N-2}+1$ flags of length $N$, and arrange them into a large flag of size $\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N$. This flag contains a non-monochrome column since the flags are distinct; we may assume that this column is the first one. By the pigeonhole principle, this column contains at least $\\left\\lceil\\frac{2^{N-2}+1}{2}\\right\\rceil=2^{N-3}+1$ squares of one color (say, blue). We call the flags with a blue first square good.\n\nConsider all the good flags and remove the first square from each of them. We obtain at least $2^{N-3}+1 \\geq M_{N-1}$ flags of length $N-1$; by the induction hypothesis, $N-1$ of them\n\n\n\ncan form a square $Q$ with the monochrome diagonal. Now, returning the removed squares, we obtain a rectangle $(N-1) \\times N$, and our aim is to supplement it on the top by one more flag.\n\nIf $Q$ has a yellow diagonal, then we can take each flag with a yellow first square (it exists by a choice of the first column; moreover, it is not used in $Q$ ). Conversely, if the diagonal of $Q$ is blue then we can take any of the $\\geq 2^{N-3}+1-(N-1)>0$ remaining good flags. So, in both cases we get a desired $N \\times N$ square.", "We present a different proof of the estimate $M_{N} \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$. We do not use the induction, involving Hall's lemma on matchings instead.\n\nConsider arbitrary $2^{N-2}+1$ distinct flags and arrange them into a large $\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N$ flag. Construct two bipartite graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$ with the common set of vertices as follows. Let $V$ and $V^{\\prime}$ be the set of columns and the set of flags under consideration, respectively. Next, let the edge $(c, f)$ appear in $E_{\\mathrm{y}}$ if the intersection of column $c$ and flag $f$ is yellow, and $(c, f) \\in E_{\\mathrm{b}}$ otherwise. Then we have to prove exactly that one of the graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$ contains a matching with all the vertices of $V$ involved.\n\nAssume that these matchings do not exist. By Hall's lemma, it means that there exist two sets of columns $S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\subset V$ such that $\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|-1$ and $\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-1$ (in the left-hand sides, $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$ denote respectively the sets of all vertices connected to $S_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{b}}$ in the corresponding graphs). Our aim is to prove that this is impossible. Note that $S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq V$ since $N \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$.\n\nFirst, suppose that $S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq \\varnothing$, so there exists some $c \\in S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Note that each flag is connected to $c$ either in $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ or in $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$, hence $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)=V^{\\prime}$. Hence we have $2^{N-2}+1=\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|+\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|+\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-2 \\leq 2 N-4$; this is impossible for $N \\geq 4$.\n\nSo, we have $S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\varnothing$. Let $y=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|, b=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|$. From the construction of our graph, we have that all the flags in the set $V^{\\prime \\prime}=V^{\\prime} \\backslash\\left(E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right)$ have blue squares in the columns of $S_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and yellow squares in the columns of $S_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Hence the only undetermined positions in these flags are the remaining $N-y-b$ ones, so $2^{N-y-b} \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\geq$ $2^{N-2}+1-(y-1)-(b-1)$, or, denoting $c=y+b, 2^{N-c}+c>2^{N-2}+2$.

Divide the board into $2 \\times 2$ pieces; we call these pieces blocks. Each block can contain not more than one king (otherwise these two kings would attack each other); hence, by the pigeonhole principle each block must contain exactly one king.\n\nNow assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{T}$ or $\\mathrm{B}$ if a king is placed in its top or bottom half, respectively. Similarly, assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{L}$ or $\\mathrm{R}$ if a king stands in its left or right half. So we define T-blocks, B-blocks, L-blocks, and $R$-blocks. We also combine the letters; we call a block $a T L$-block if it is simultaneously T-block and L-block. Similarly we define TR-blocks, $B L$-blocks, and BR-blocks. The arrangement of blocks determines uniquely the arrangement of kings; so in the rest of the solution we consider the $50 \\times 50$ system of blocks (see Fig. 1). We identify the blocks by their coordinate pairs; the pair $(i, j)$, where $1 \\leq i, j \\leq 50$, refers to the $j$ th block in the $i$ th row (or the $i$ th block in the $j$ th column).

In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n<img_3973>\n\nFig. 1\n\n<img_3920>\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns.

This is a classic problem in combinatorial design, specifically related to the construction of a 100 by 100 grid where each row and each column has exactly 25 kings, and no two kings are adjacent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraints. Since no two kings can be adjacent, each king must be placed such that there is at least one empty square between any two kings in both the horizontal and vertical directions. This means that each king effectively occupies a $3 \\times 3$ block of squares (the king itself plus the 8 surrounding squares).\n\nGiven that each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings, we can think of placing the kings in a way that they are spread out as much as possible. One way to achieve this is to use a pattern where the kings are placed in a checkerboard-like manner, but with a specific periodicity that ensures the constraints are met.\n\nA known solution to this problem is to use a specific type of combinatorial design called a \"balanced incomplete block design\" (BIBD), specifically a $(100, 25, 1)$-BIBD.

Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes.

We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle.

Let's start by analyzing the structure of the diagonals and triangles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Diagonals:**\n   - A diagonal of a regular 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if we label the vertices of the 2006-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{2006}\\), a diagonal \\(A_iA_j\\) is odd if both \\(i-j\\) and \\(2006 - (i-j)\\) are odd.

We need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.\n\n3. **Properties of Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - An isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its base as an odd side or an odd diagonal. This is because the two equal sides must be either sides of the 2006-gon or odd diagonals, and the third side (the base) must also be an odd side or an odd diagonal to satisfy the condition of having two odd sides.\n\n4. **Counting the Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - In a regular 2006-gon, each vertex is connected to 1002 other vertices by diagonals (since 2006 is even, each vertex is connected to half of the other vertices by diagonals). Out of these 1002 diagonals, half of them are odd (since the number of odd differences modulo 2006 is half of 2006).\n   - When we dissect the 2006-gon into triangles, each triangle will have at least one side that is a side of the 2006-gon or an odd diagonal. To maximize the number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides, we need to consider the structure of the dissection. Each triangle that is isosceles with two odd sides will have its base as an odd side or an odd diagonal, and the two equal sides will also be odd sides or odd diagonals.\n   - The maximum number of such triangles is achieved when we consider the structure of the dissection and the properties of the diagonals. By carefully analyzing the dissection, we can see that the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is 1003. This is because each vertex of the 2006-gon can be the vertex of two such triangles, and there are 1003 such vertices in the dissection.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\)."], "pred": ["1003"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

Any other cube $a$ in $X \\cap M_{2}$ corresponds to some $a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z$ (possibly with $a^{\\prime} \\in X$ ), so there are at most $n$ of them. All this results in $\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant(2 n-1)+n=3 n-1$, which is even better than we need (by the assumptions of our case).\n\nSumming up the inequalities from the Claim over all $x$-boxes $X$, we obtain\n\n$$\n4 n_{1}+n_{2} \\leqslant n(3 n+1) .\n$$\n\nObviously, we also have $n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=n^{3}$.\n\nNow we are prepared to estimate $C$.

Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope.

In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1.

Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.", "First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to understand the constraints and the structure of the circles and their tangents. We start by noting that each pair of circles can have at most two common external tangents. Since no two circles are tangent and no three circles share a common tangent, each pair of circles will contribute exactly two external tangents.\n\nWhen Luciano draws a tangent segment, he is essentially connecting two points on the circumferences of two circles. The key constraint is that no tangent segment can intersect any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments. This means that each tangent segment must be drawn in such a way that it does not cross any other tangents or circles.\n\nThe maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 circles out of 2017, multiplied by 2 (since each pair of circles contributes 2 tangents).

The maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn without any intersections is the same as the maximum number of non-intersecting tangent segments, which is the same as the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 2017 vertices (each circle is a vertex, and each tangent segment is an edge).\n\nIn a planar graph with \\( n \\) vertices, the maximum number of edges is \\( 3n - 6 \\) (for \\( n \\geq 3 \\)).

Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$.

At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 .

We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$.

B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good.

After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin.

This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)", "We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins.

Specifically, if there are \\( k \\) heads, flipping the \\( k \\)-th coin will reduce the number of heads by 1 (since the \\( k \\)-th coin was originally a head and is now a tail).

When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$.

If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.", "We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is \"on the right\" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the value of \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) for a labyrinth \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with \\( n \\) walls, we need to analyze the structure of the labyrinth and the constraints imposed by the coloring of the walls.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the labyrinth. Each pair of walls intersects at a unique point, and at each intersection, there is a door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners where sides of different colors meet. This means that the labyrinth is divided into regions, and each region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of the walls.\n\nThe key observation is that the labyrinth can be viewed as a planar graph where the vertices are the intersection points of the walls, and the edges are the doors connecting these vertices. The number of regions (or cells) in the labyrinth is given by the formula for the number of regions formed by \\( n \\) lines in general position, which is \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the problem of placing knights in the labyrinth such that no two knights can meet. This is equivalent to finding the maximum independent set in the graph formed by the regions and the doors. An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent.\n\nFor a planar graph, the maximum independent set is at least half the number of vertices. This is because we can color the vertices of the graph in two colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is known as a 2-coloring or a bipartite coloring of the graph. In a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is the size of the larger part of the bipartition.\n\nIn our case, the graph is planar and has \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \\) vertices. Therefore, the maximum independent set is at least half of this number. However, we need to consider the specific structure of the labyrinth, which is a special type of planar graph known as a planar bipartite graph. For a planar bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is exactly half the number of vertices.\n\nThus, the maximum number of knights that can be placed such that no two knights can meet is:\n\\[\nk(\\mathfrak{L}) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n(n+1)}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nHowever, for large \\( n \\), the term \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) becomes negligible, and we can approximate \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) as:\n\\[\nk(\\mathfrak{L}) \\approx \\frac{n(n+1)}{4}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the exact value of \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) is:\n\\[\nk(\\mathfrak{L}) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n(n+1)}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n(n+1)}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\n\\]"], "pred": ["\\lfloor\\frac{n(n+1)}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}\\rfloor"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move.

In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

Now provided that $f$ is injective, (2) tells us that $f$ is the successor function.

A straightforward induction using (2) in the induction step reveals that we have $f(a+n)=f(b+n)$ for all nonnegative integers $n$.

Now let $(a, b, c)$ be any triple with the desired property. If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct.\n\nDue to symmetry we may suppose that\n\n$$\n2 \\leqslant a<b<c .\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nWe are to prove that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,6,11)$ or $(3,5,7)$.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$. Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 . Thus $\\alpha \\leqslant 4$ and we get a contradiction to (5).\n\n\n\nCase 2.2. $a \\geqslant 3$.\n\nPick an integer $\\vartheta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ such that $c-\\vartheta$ is not divisible by 4 .

On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.", "As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$.\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other $\\overline{\\text { words, }} L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$.\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$.

By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\n\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$. Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N !}=R_{i}$.

Due to symmetry it is enough for this purpose to prove $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$ for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$. In fact we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|=y^{2}+\\frac{x^{2}}{C}+\\frac{(|x|-C)^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant \\frac{x^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nwhere in the first estimate equality can only hold if $|x|=C$, whilst in the second one it can only hold if $x=0$. As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1). Notice that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| & \\Longleftrightarrow\\left(y^{2}-x^{2}-1\\right)^{2} \\leqslant 4 x^{2} \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left(\\left(y^{2}-(x-1)^{2}\\right)\\left((x+1)^{2}-y^{2}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant(y-x+1)(y+x-1)(x+1-y)(x+1+y) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left((x+y)^{2}-1\\right)\\left(1-(x-y)^{2}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this inequality is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we are done.\n\nPart II. Now we show that no values other than those mentioned in the answer are possible for $P(0)$. To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$.

We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$.

In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint.

This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$.

For any two disjoint sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $n$, we write $A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ to mean $(-B) \\prec(-A)$. It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

In fact, we prove this statement in a modified game which is more difficult for the gardener: on the lumberjack's turn in the modified game, he may decrement the height of all trees on the board except those the gardener did not just grow, in addition to four of the trees the gardener just grew.

Both operations preserve the sign, thus we can not generate any tuple that has negative $i$-th coordinate. Similarly for $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\leqslant 0$.\n\nSuppose the opposite, i.e., for every $i$ we have either $\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0>\\mathbf{w}_{i}$, or $\\mathbf{v}_{i}<0<\\mathbf{w}_{i}$. Since we assumed that our tuples have at least three coordinates, by pigeonhole principle there exist two coordinates $j \\neq k$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{w}_{k}$ (because there are only two possible combinations of signs).\n\nWithout loss of generality assume that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}, \\mathbf{v}_{k}>0$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}, \\mathbf{w}_{k}<0$. Let us denote the positive real number $\\mathbf{v}_{j} / \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ by $a$. If $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both inequalities $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ are satisfied. On the other hand, if $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both $\\mathbf{v}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{v}_{j}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{w}_{j}$ are satisfied. In either case, we have found the desired inequality satisfied by both starting tuples, a contradiction with the observation above."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the smallest possible number \\( s \\) of initial 2022-tuples that Lucy needs to write in order to generate any integer-valued 2022-tuple through the given operations, we need to analyze the properties of the operations and the structure of the tuples.\n\nFirst, let's consider the operations:\n1. \\(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}\\) adds the corresponding components of two tuples.\n2. \\(\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}\\) takes the component-wise maximum of two tuples.\n\nWe need to show that with a carefully chosen set of initial tuples, we can generate any 2022-tuple. Let's start by considering the simplest case where \\( s = 1 \\). If Lucy starts with only one tuple, say \\(\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2022})\\), she can only generate tuples that are linear combinations of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and the maximum operation.

However, even with these operations, it is not clear how to generate tuples with components that are smaller than the minimum of the components of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\( s = 3 \\). Suppose Lucy starts with three tuples, \\(\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2022})\\), \\(\\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{2022})\\), and \\(\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_{2022})\\).

By carefully choosing the initial tuples, it is possible to generate tuples with components that are any integer values, as the maximum operation can be used to adjust the components to any desired value.\n\nTo see why \\( s = 3 \\) is sufficient, consider the following strategy:\n1. Start with three tuples \\(\\mathbf{a} = (0, 0, \\ldots, 0)\\), \\(\\mathbf{b} = (1, 1, \\ldots, 1)\\), and \\(\\mathbf{c} = (-1, -1, \\ldots, -1)\\).\n2.

We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in $B$.\n\nWe note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved. This amounts to finding a way of marking a certain set of squares, those that have a value of 1 in $B$, such that no two unmarked squares are adjacent and that the marked squares form a connected tree with respect to adjacency.\n\nFor $n=1$ and $n=2$ the markings are respectively the lone field and the L-trimino.

Obviously, this path is connected. Now, let us consider the fields $(2,6 k+s)$ and $(1,6 k+s+3)$. For each considered field $(i, j)$ we will mark all squares of the form $(l, j)$ for $l>i$ and $(i+2 k, j \\pm 1)$.

The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane.

We use induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is routine.

In the sequel, we assume that $k<n-1$.\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as $n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))$, or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n$$\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}$. By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$.

To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell. Hence, to connect these two parts of the path, there must be\n\n\n\na path connecting the cell $(a, b+3)$ and $(a, b)$ and also a path connecting $(a+2, b+2)$ and $(a-1, b+2)$.\n\nBut these four cells are opposite vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the paths are outside of that quadrilateral and hence they must intersect. This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside. Thus the path between these two points must cross the previous path.\n\nBut an intersection is only possible if a cell is visited twice. This is a contradiction.\n\nHence the number of cells visited is at most $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nThe following picture indicates a recursive construction for all $n \\times n$-chessboards with $n \\equiv 3$ mod 4 which clearly yields a path that misses exactly one $A$-cell (marked with a dot, the center cell of the $15 \\times 15$-chessboard) and hence, in the case of $n=999$ crosses exactly $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$ cells.\n\n<img_3771>"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a countable Rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board, we need to consider the movement constraints and the structure of the board.\n\n1. **Movement Constraints**:\n   - The Rook can move to any adjacent square (up, down, left, or right).\n   - Each move must be a turn, meaning the direction of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular.\n\n2. **Non-Intersecting Route**:\n   - The route must visit each square exactly once before returning to the starting square to form a cyclic route.\n\n3. **Board Structure**:\n   - The board is a \\(999 \\times 999\\) grid, which means it has \\(999^2 = 998001\\) squares.\n\n4. ** route length**:\n   - Since the route must visit each square exactly once and return to the starting square, the total number of squares visited in a cyclic, non-intersecting route is \\(998001\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - We need to ensure that such a route is possible.

(This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$.

If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$.

Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above.

Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$.

On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.", "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). We first notice with $m=n$ that $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nLemma 3. For every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, f(3 n)=3 f(n)$ holds.\n\nProof. Define $c=f(n), d=f(3 n)$. Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$. In particular $a$ is odd and $a>3$. Consider the three integers $a, \\frac{a-3}{2}, \\frac{a+3}{2}$. By pigeonhole principle two of them have the same color.\n\n- If $\\frac{a-3}{2}$ and $\\frac{a+3}{2}$ have the same color, then $f(a)=\\frac{a-3}{2} f(1)+\\frac{a+3}{2} f(1)=a f(1)$.\n- If $a$ and $\\frac{a-3}{2}$ have the same color, then $3 \\frac{a-1}{2} f(1)=3 f\\left(\\frac{a-1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{3 a-3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+f\\left(\\frac{a-3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+$ $\\frac{a-3}{2} f(1)$, so $f(a)=a f(1)$.\n- If $a$ and $\\frac{a+3}{2}$ have the same color, then $3 \\frac{a+1}{2} f(1)=3 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{3 a+3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+f\\left(\\frac{a+3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+$ $\\frac{a+3}{2} f(1)$, so $f(a)=a f(1)$.\n\nIn the three cases we find a contradiction with $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$, so it finishes the proof.", "As before we prove that $k \\leq 3$ and for any such function and colouring we have $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nNow we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii).

Without loss of generality we may assume that $m+n, m$ are black and $n$ is white.\n\nLemma 4. For all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and every $x$ whose color is black, we have $x+l m$ is black and $f(x+\\operatorname{lm})=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5. For every $l \\geq 1,2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\n\n\nProof. On the one hand we have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l-1}(2 m+n)+2^{l-1} n\\right)$. On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$.

For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately. Since we know $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}, 2^{k-1}$ is the minimum possible value of $m$ as claimed."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the smallest integer \\( m \\) such that Lexi can fill her \\( k \\times k \\) grid with strings from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) in the specified manner, we need to analyze the constraints and properties of the grid and the set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the grid. Each column of the grid is a string from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) and each row of the grid is also a string from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). This means that each string in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) must appear exactly once in each row and each column. This is a classic problem of constructing a Latin square where each row and each column contains each element exactly once.\n\nFor a \\( k \\times k \\) grid, we need \\( k \\) different strings in each row and each column. The smallest number of different strings that can satisfy this condition is \\( k \\). If \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) contains fewer than \\( k \\) different strings, it is impossible to fill the grid such that each row and each column contains a different string from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\n\nTo see why \\( m = k \\) is sufficient, consider the following construction: if \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) contains at least \\( k \\) different strings, we can choose any \\( k \\) of these strings to fill the first row, any of the remaining \\( k \\) strings to fill the second row, and so on, ensuring that each column also contains a different string.

(The two 8 's are 8 positions apart, and the two 6 's must be 6 positions apart.)\n\nThus, the sequence so far is:\n$( \\ldots,\\ldots,1,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,\\ldots,8,6,4,2, \\ldots, 2,4,6,8)$\n\nThe numbers that we have left to place are $1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9$, and empty positions are $1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,14$.\n\nSince the 9's must be 9 positions apart, they must be placed in positions 5 and 14 .\n\nThus, we have\n\n$$\n(\\ldots, \\ldots, 1, \\ldots, 9, \\ldots, \\ldots, \\ldots, \\ldots, 8,6,4,2,9,2,4,6,8)\n$$\n\nThe remaining 1 must be placed in position 2 or 4 . If it is placed in position 2 , then the 7 's can only go in positions 1 and 8 , giving\n\n$$\n(7,1,1, \\ldots, 9, \\ldots, \\ldots, 7, \\ldots, 8,6,4,2,9,2,4,6,8)\n$$\n\nBut we now cannot place both the two 3's and the two 5's. (The placing of one of these pairs means that the other pair cannot be placed.)\n\nWe conclude that the only possibility is that the remaining 1 must be placed in position 4 . This gives\n\n$$\n(\\ldots, \\ldots, 1,1,9, \\ldots, \\ldots, \\ldots, 8,6,4,2,9,2,4,6,8)\n$$\n\nwith 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7 left to be placed in positions $1,2,6,7,8,9$.\n\nNow the two 3's must be placed in positions 6 and 9, so the 7's must be placed in positions 1 and 8 , and finally the 5's must be placed in positions 2 and 7 .\n\nTherefore, the only Skolem sequence satisfying the given conditions is $(7,5,1,1,9,3,5,7,3,8,6,4,2,9,2,4,6,8)$"], "answer_type": "Tuple", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine all Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy the given conditions, we need to carefully analyze the properties and constraints of Skolem sequences. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Skolem Sequences\nA Skolem sequence of order \\( n \\) is a sequence \\( (s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{2n}) \\) of \\( 2n \\) integers such that:\n1. For every \\( k \\) in \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} \\), there exist exactly two elements \\( s_i \\) and \\( s_j \\) with \\( s_i = s_j = k \\).\n2. If \\( s_i = s_j = k \\) with \\( i < j \\), then \\( j - i = k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Conditions\nWe are given:\n1. \\( s_3 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( s_{18} = 8 \\)\n3. Between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Sequence\nSince \\( s_3 = 1 \\), the number 1 must appear exactly twice in the sequence. Similarly, since \\( s_{18} = 8 \\), the number 8 must also appear exactly twice in the sequence.\n\n### Step 4: Distributing the Even Numbers\nThe even numbers in the sequence are 2, 4, 6, and 8. We need to place these even numbers such that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\n### Step 5: Placing the Even Numbers\nLet's denote the positions of the even numbers as follows:\n- \\( s_i = 2 \\)\n- \\( s_j = 4 \\)\n- \\( s_k = 6 \\)\n- \\( s_l = 8 \\)\n\nGiven the condition that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer, we can place the even numbers in the sequence as follows:\n- \\( s_2 = 2 \\)\n- \\( s_4 = 4 \\)\n- \\( s_6 = 6 \\)\n- \\( s_8 = 8 \\)\n\nThis placement ensures that there is exactly one odd integer between each pair of even numbers.\n\n### Step 6: Placing the Odd Numbers\nWe need to place the odd numbers in the remaining positions. The odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. We already know:\n- \\( s_3 = 1 \\)\n- \\( s_{18} = 8 \\)\n\nThe remaining odd numbers are 3, 5, 7, and 9. We need to place these in the sequence such that the conditions of the Skolem sequence are satisfied.\n\n### Step 7: Constructing the Sequence\nLet's construct the sequence step by step:\n1. \\( s_1 = 3 \\)\n2. \\( s_2 = 2 \\)\n3. \\( s_3 = 1 \\)\n4. \\( s_4 = 4 \\)\n5. \\( s_5 = 5 \\)\n6. \\( s_6 = 6 \\)\n7. \\( s_7 = 7 \\)\n8. \\( s_8 = 8 \\)\n9. \\( s_9 = 9 \\)\n10. \\( s_{10} = 3 \\)\n11. \\( s_{11} = 5 \\)\n12. \\( s_{12} = 7 \\)\n13. \\( s_{13} = 9 \\)\n14. \\( s_{14} = 3 \\)\n15. \\( s_{15} = 5 \\)\n16. \\( s_{16} = 7 \\)\n17. \\( s_{17} = 9 \\)\n18. \\( s_{18} = 8 \\)\n\n### Step 8: Verifying the Sequence\nWe need to verify that this sequence satisfies all the conditions:\n1. Each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly twice.\n2. The positions of the even numbers satisfy the condition that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n3. \\( s_3 = 1 \\) and \\( s_{18} = 8 \\).\n\nThe sequence \\( (3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 5, 7, 9, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8) \\) satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Skolem sequence of order 9 that satisfies all the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 5, 7, 9, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8)}\n\\]"], "pred": ["(3,2,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,3,5,7,9,3,5,7,9,8)"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 .

Therefore, the units digit of \\( \\binom{4}{n-1} \\) is 1 if and only if \\( n-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\), or equivalently, \\( n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nWe need to count how many integers \\( n \\) from 1 to 2014 satisfy \\( n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\). These numbers form an arithmetic sequence: 1, 6, 11, ..., 2011. The number of terms in this sequence is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{2011 - 1}{5} + 1 = 403\n\\]\nThus, there are 403 integers \\( n \\) from 1 to 2014 such that \\( f(n) \\) has a units digit of 1.

Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$ follow automatically, so only $c<a+b$ ever needs to be checked.\n\nInstead of directly considering triangles and sets of triangle, we can consider triples $(a, b, c)$ and sets of triples $(a, b, c)$ with the appropriate conditions.\n\nFor each positive integer $k \\geq 3$, we use the notation $S_{k}$ to denote the set of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$.\n\nIn this case, $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$, so $c+c<a+b+c=k$, so $2 c<k$ or $c<\\frac{1}{2} k$.\n\nAlso, if $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b+c=k$, then $k=a+b+c \\leq c+c+c$, so $3 c \\geq k$ or $c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} k$.\n\n\nWe will use two important facts:\n\n(F1) $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ for every positive integer $m \\geq 3$, and\n\n(F2) $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$ for every positive integer $k \\geq 3$\n\nFirst, we prove (F1):\n\n\nWe show that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ by creating a one-to-one correspondence between the triples in $S_{2 m}$ and the triples $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nNote that $S_{2 m}$ is the set of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, with $c<a+b$, and with $a+b+c=2 m$.\n\nAlso, $S_{2 m-3}$ is the set of triples $(A, B, C)$ of positive integers with $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, with $C<A+B$, and with $A+B+C=2 m-3$.\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{2 m}$ and a corresponding triple $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$.\n\nWe show that $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$ :\n\n* Since $(a, b, c)$ is in $S_{2 m}$, then $c<\\frac{1}{2}(2 m)=m$. This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal. In this case, $a=\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)$. Therefore, if $c$ is odd, there are $\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are 104,106,...,152,154 (there are 26 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are 103,105,...,151,153 (there are 26 such values).\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(309)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-154\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-154\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(154)-154\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+154)-26 \\cdot 154+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+153+154)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+154)(52)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(26)(257)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & 2028\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(309)>2010$, as required.\n\nCalculation of $T(307)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{307}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{307}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 153$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=307-c$.\n\nThis can be done in a similar way to the calculation of $T(309)$ above.\n\nIf $n$ is even, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-153$ possible triples.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{305}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are $104,106, \\ldots, 150,152$ (there are 25 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are $103,105, \\ldots, 151,153$ (there are 26 such values).\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(307)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-153\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-153\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(152)-153\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+152)-25 \\cdot 153+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+152+153)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+153)(51)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(51)(128)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & 2002\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(307)<2010$, as required.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$ is $n=309$.\n\nAs a final note, we discuss briefly how one could guess that the answer was near $N=309$.\n\nConsider the values of $T(n)$ for small odd positive integers $n$.\n\nIn (a), by considering the possible values of $c$ from smallest (roughly $\\frac{1}{3} n$ ) to largest (roughly $\\frac{1}{2} n$ ), we saw that $T(11)=1+3=4$.\n\nIf we continue to calculate $T(n)$ for a few more small odd values of $n$ we will see that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& T(13)=2+3=5 \\\\\n& T(15)=1+2+4=7 \\\\\n& T(17)=1+3+4=8 \\\\\n& T(19)=2+3+5=10 \\\\\n& T(21)=1+2+4+5=12 \\\\\n& T(23)=1+3+4+6=14\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nThe pattern that seems to emerge is that for $n$ odd, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$, with one out of every three integers removed.

In other words, we complete the following table:\n\n<img_3502>\n\nWe note that the table is symmetric, since the factors of $p$ and $q$ are interchangeable.\n\nWe proceed to consider cases, considering only those on the top left to bottom right diagonal and and those below this diagonal in the table.\n\n\n\nCase 1: One part divisible by $p$, one part divisible by $q$\n\nThe partition must be $p^{3} q^{3}$ ( $n$ itself) or $p^{3} \\times q^{3}$.\n\nThere are two partitions in this case.\n\nCase 2: One part divisible by $p$, two parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ occur together as $p^{3}$. The three factors of $q$ occur as $q$ and $q^{2}$.\n\nThe $p^{3}$ can occur in one of the parts divisible by $q$ or not.\n\nThis gives partitions $p^{3} \\times q \\times q^{2}$ and $p^{3} q \\times q^{2}$ and $q \\times p^{3} q^{2}$.\n\nThere are three partitions in this case. Similarly, there are three partitions with one part divisible by $q$ and two parts divisible by $p$.\n\nCase 3: One part divisible by $p$, three parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ occur together as $p^{3}$. The three factors of $q$ occur as $q, q$ and $q$.\n\nThe $p^{3}$ can occur in one of the parts divisible by $q$ or not.\n\nThis gives partitions $p^{3} \\times q \\times q \\times q$ and $p^{3} q \\times q \\times q$.\n\n(Note that the three divisors of $q$ are interchangeable so $p^{3}$ only needs to be placed with one of them.)\n\nThere are two partitions in this case. Similarly, there are two partitions with one part divisible by $q$ and three parts divisible by $p$.\n\nCase 4: Two parts divisible by $p$, two parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ occur as $p$ and $p^{2}$. The three factors of $q$ occur as $q$ and $q^{2}$.\n\nEach of $p$ and $p^{2}$ can occur in one of the parts divisible by $q$ or not.\n\nIf no part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, we have one partition: $p \\times p^{2} \\times q \\times q^{2}$.\n\nIf one part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there are two choices for which power of $p$ to include in this part and two choices for which power of $q$ to include. (There is no choice for the remaining parts.) Thus, there are $2 \\times 2=4$ such partitions:\n\n$$\np^{2} q^{2} \\times p \\times q \\quad p q^{2} \\times p^{2} \\times q \\quad p^{2} q \\times p \\times q^{2} \\quad p q \\times p^{2} \\times q^{2}\n$$\n\nIf two parts are a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there are two ways to choose the power of $p$ in the part containing just $q$, so there are two such partitions: $p q \\times p^{2} q^{2}$ and $p^{2} q \\times p q^{2}$. There are seven partitions in this case.\n\nCase 5: Two parts divisible by $p$, three parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ occur as $p$ and $p^{2}$. The three factors of $q$ occur as $q, q$ and $q$.\n\nEach of $p$ and $p^{2}$ can occur in one of the parts divisible by $q$ or not.\n\nIf no part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, we have one partition: $p \\times p^{2} \\times q \\times q \\times q$.\n\nIf one part is a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there are two choices for which power of $p$ to include in this part (since all powers of $q$ are identical).\n\nThus, there are 2 such partitions: $p^{2} q \\times p \\times q \\times q$ and $p q \\times p^{2} \\times q \\times q$.\n\nIf two parts are a multiple of both $p$ and $q$, there is one partition, since all of the powers of $q$ are identical: $p q \\times p^{2} q \\times q$.\n\nThere are four partitions in this case. Similarly, there are four partitions with two parts divisible by $q$ and three parts divisible by $p$.\n\nCase 6: Three parts divisible by $p$, three parts divisible by $q$\n\nThe three factors of $p$ as $p, p$ and $p$. The three factors of $q$ appear as $q, q$ and $q$.\n\nHere, the number of parts in the partition that are multiples of both $p$ and $q$ can be 0 , 1,2 or 3 . Since all of the powers of $p$ and $q$ are identical, the partitions are completely determined by this and are\n\n$$\np \\times p \\times p \\times q \\times q \\times q \\quad p \\times p \\times p q \\times q \\times q \\quad p \\times p q \\times p q \\times q \\quad p q \\times p q \\times p q\n$$\n\nThere are four partitions in this case.\n\n\n\nFinally, we complete the table:\n\nNumber of parts divisible by $p$ (Column)\n\nNumber of parts divisible by $q$ (Row)\n\n|  | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 |\n| 2 | 3 | 7 | 4 |\n| 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 |\n\nAdding the entries in the table, we obtain $P\\left(p^{3} q^{3}\\right)=31$.\n\nThus, $P(1000)=31$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the value of \\( P(1000) \\), we need to count the number of multiplicative partitions of 1000.

(We'll count the string $A B B A B B A B B A$ later.)\n\nIf a string contains exactly two substrings of $A B B A$ and these do not overlap, then it must be of one of the following forms:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\nA B B A A B B A x x & A B B A x A B B A x & A B B A x x A B B A \\\\\nx A B B A A B B A x & x A B B A x A B B A & x x A B B A A B B A\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSince there are 6 such forms and 2 choices for each of the 2 unknown letters in each case, then there appear to be $6 \\cdot 2^{2}=24$ such strings.\n\nThis total includes the string $A B B A B B A B B A$ in the third category, so we subtract 1 from this total to obtain 23 , the total number of strings of ten letters that include exactly two copies of $A B B A$ which do not overlap.\n\nSo there are 30 strings that contain exactly two overlapping substrings $A B B A, 23$ strings that contain exactly two non-overlapping substrings $A B B A$, and 1 string that contains exactly three substrings $A B B A$.\n\nTo get the total number of strings with one or more substrings $A B B A$ we take the total number of occurrences of $A B B A$ (448), subtract the number of strings with exactly two substrings $A B B A$ (since these were included twice in the original count), and subtract two times the number of strings with exactly three substrings $A B B A$ (since these were included three times in the original count).\n\nTherefore, there are $448-23-30-2 \\cdot 1=393$ strings that include at least one substring\n$A B B A$, and so there are $1024-393=631$ strings of ten letters that do not include the substring $A B B A$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the total number of strings of ten letters, each of which is \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), that do not include the consecutive letters \\(A B B A\\), we can use a recursive approach.

Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "\\frac{}{2k(-k)!}", "unit": null, "solution": ["First, we compute the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$.\n\nBecause the town is full, each pair of dishes is cooked by exactly one resident, so it is simplest to identify residents by the pairs of dishes they cook. Suppose the first resident cooks $\\left(d_{1}, d_{2}\\right)$, the second resident $\\left(d_{2}, d_{3}\\right)$, the third resident $\\left(d_{3}, d_{4}\\right)$, and so on, until the sixth resident, who cooks $\\left(d_{6}, d_{1}\\right)$. Then there are 8 choices for $d_{1}$ and 7 choices for $d_{2}$. There are only 6 choices for $d_{3}$, because $d_{3} \\neq d_{1}$ (otherwise two residents would cook the same pair of dishes). For $k>3$, the requirement that no two intermediate residents cook the same dishes implies that $d_{k+1}$ cannot equal any of $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{k-1}$, and of course $d_{k}$ and $d_{k+1}$ must be distinct dishes. Hence there are $8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3=20,160$ six-person resident cycles, not accounting for different starting points in the cycle and the two different directions to go around the cycle.

For a number \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) bits, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's is the number of positions where there are two consecutive 1's.

If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$.

We will use the change of base formula and properties of logarithms to simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify \\(2^{\\log_T 8}\\)\n\nWe know that \\(8 = 2^3\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\\[\n2^{\\log_T 8} = 2^{\\log_T (2^3)}\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms \\(\\log_b (a^c) = c \\log_b a\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\log_T (2^3) = 3 \\log_T 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n2^{\\log_T 8} = 2^{3 \\log_T 2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify \\(8^{\\log_T 2}\\)\n\nWe know that \\(8 = 2^3\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\\[\n8^{\\log_T 2} = (2^3)^{\\log_T 2}\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of exponents \\((a^b)^c = a^{bc}\\), we get:\n\\[\n(2^3)^{\\log_T 2} = 2^{3 \\log_T 2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results\n\nNow we have:\n\\[\n2^{\\log_T 8} = 2^{3 \\log_T 2}\n\\]\n\\[\n8^{\\log_T 2} = 2^{3 \\log_T 2}\n\\]\n\nSince both expressions are equal, we can subtract them:\n\\[\n2^{\\log_T 8} - 8^{\\log_T 2} = 2^{3 \\log_T 2} - 2^{3 \\log_T 2} = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"], "pred": ["0"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

If we take the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\), the number 1 is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, so it is crom�le. The other numbers are not crom�le because they share common factors with other numbers in the sequence. Therefore, the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) has exactly one crom�le element.\n\nTo confirm that this is the minimum, we need to check if it is possible to have exactly two crom�le elements. If we take the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) again, we see that 1 and 2 are crom�le. However, if we take a different sequence, such as \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\), the only crom�le number is 7, because 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not crom�le. Therefore, it is not possible to have exactly two crom�le elements in any sequence of 6 consecutive integers.\n\nThus, the minimum number of crom�le elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive integers is 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of crom�le elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 0, and the minimum number of crom�le elements is 1.

The probability of rolling a 17 is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and the probability of rolling any other number (1 through 16) is \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\).\n\nFor the pairs that sum to 20:\n- The pair (3, 17) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{64} \\).\n- The pair (4, 16) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (5, 15) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (6, 14) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (7, 13) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (8, 12) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (9, 11) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (10, 10) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (11, 9) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (12, 8) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (13, 7) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (14, 6) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (15, 5) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (16, 4) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (17, 3) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{64} \\).\n\nAdding these probabilities together, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + 12 \\times \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{12}{1024} = \\frac{2}{64} + \\frac{12}{1024} = \\frac{32}{1024} + \\frac{12}{1024} = \\frac{44}{1024} = \\frac{11}{256}. \\]\n\nFor the pairs that sum to 12:\n- The pair (5, 7) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (6, 6) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n- The pair (7, 5) has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\).\n\nAdding these probabilities together, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{3}{1024}. \\]\n\nFinally, adding the probabilities of the sums of 20 and 12, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{11}{256} + \\frac{3}{1024} = \\frac{44}{1024} + \\frac{3}{1024} = \\frac{47}{1024}. \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the sum of two rolls is either 20 or 12 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1024}}\\)."], "pred": ["\\frac{47}{1024}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The graph of $g$ is shown below:\n\n<img_3987>\n\nBecause $g(x)$ is the (vertical) distance between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the fact that $g$ is periodic implies that $f$ always stays within some fixed distance $D$ of the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$. On the other hand, because $\\frac{10}{3}>\\sqrt{11}$, the graph of $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$ gets further and further away from the graph of $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ as $x$ increases.

If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$.

Since 33 = 3 × 11, \\( N \\) must be divisible by both 3 and 11.\n\nFirst, let's consider the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Next, for 11, a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.\n\nWe start by finding the smallest \\( T \\)-digit number, which is \\( 10^{T-1} \\).

We can do this by dividing \\( 10^{T-1} \\) by 33 and rounding up to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by 33.\n\nLet's illustrate this with an example. Suppose \\( T = 3 \\).

There are only 16 strings of four 0's and 1's. In addition, because 16 and 625 are relatively prime, it will be shown below that for each such string $s$, there exists exactly one integer $x_{s}$ in the range $0 \\leq x_{s}<10000$ such that the base- 2 and base- 5 representations of $x_{s}$ end in the digits of $s$ (e.g., $x_{1001}$ is the unique positive integer less than 10000 such that $x$ 's base- 5 representation and base- 2 representation both end in 1001).\n\nHere is a proof of the preceding claim: Let $p(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 5 are the string $s$, and $b(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 2 are the string $s$. Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. These reduce to the Diophantine equation $16 n-625 m=p(s)-b(s)$, which has solutions $m, n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$, with at least one of $m, n \\geq 0$. Assuming without loss of generality that $m>0$ yields $x=p(s)+625 m \\geq 0$. To show that there exists an $x_{s}<10000$ and that it is unique, observe that the general form of the solution is $m^{\\prime}=m-16 t, n^{\\prime}=n+625 t$. Thus if $p(s)+625 m>10000$, an appropriate $t$ can be found by writing $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, which yields $p(s)+625 m-10000<10000 t \\leq p(s)+625 m$. Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example. Let $X=x_{0000}+\\cdots+x_{1111}$. Then $X$ is congruent modulo 16 to $0000_{2}+\\cdots+1111_{2}=8 \\cdot\\left(1111_{2}\\right)=8 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 8$.

A cube has 6 faces, and each face is adjacent to 4 other faces. The condition we need to satisfy is that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. This means that if we color three faces that share a common vertex with the same color, it would violate the condition.\n\nWe can start by noting that if we color three faces that share a common vertex with the same color, the fourth face adjacent to these three faces must be colored differently to avoid having three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. This implies that the cube must be colored in such a way that no three faces sharing a vertex are all the same color.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the possible colorings of the cube. If we color one face red, then the four faces adjacent to it must be blue to avoid having three red faces sharing a vertex. This leaves the last face, which is opposite to the initially colored face, to be red or blue. However, if it is blue, then we have three blue faces sharing a vertex (the initially colored face and its two adjacent faces), which violates the condition. Therefore, the last face must be red.\n\nThis means that if we start with one face colored red, the opposite face must also be red, and the four faces adjacent to the initially colored face must be blue. This is one valid coloring. By symmetry, we can also start with one face colored blue and follow a similar logic, which gives us another valid coloring.\n\nThus, there are exactly two valid colorings of the cube that satisfy the condition: one where the initially colored face and its opposite face are red, and the other where they are blue.

In the first step, a characterization of the possible final morphed sequences is given. In the second step, a lower bound on the number of steps is given, and in the third step, it is shown that this bound can be achieved.\n\nStep 1. Note the following.\n\n- The sum of the elements of $T$ is $1^{2}+2^{2}+\\cdots+10^{2}=385$, and morphs are sum-preserving. So any morphed sequence has sum 385 and a mean of 38.5.\n- The sequence $T$ has positive integer terms, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence has positive integer terms.\n- The sequence $T$ is strictly increasing, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n\n\nNow if the morphed sequence is an arithmetic progression, it follows from the above three observations that it must have the form\n\n$$\n(38.5-4.5 d, 38.5-3.5 d, \\ldots, 38.5+4.5 d)\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is an odd positive integer satisfying $38.5-4.5 d>0$.

Thus at least 56 morphs are needed to obtain sequence $A$ (and more morphs would be required to obtain any of sequences $B, C$, or $D$ ).\n\nStep 3.

First, $10=4+4+1+1=2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{0}+2^{0}$, which yields $\\frac{4 !}{2 ! \\cdot 2 !}=6$ ordered quadruples. Second, $10=4+2+2+2=2^{2}+2^{1}+2^{1}+2^{1}$, which yields 4 ordered quadruples. Thus the contribution of the $(f(x))^{4}$ term is $6+4=10$.\n\nThe last term to consider is $f(x)^{8}$, because $(f(x))^{n}$ contains no terms of degree less than $n$. An analogous analysis to the case of $(f(x))^{4}$ suggests that the expansion of $(f(x))^{8}$ has an $x^{10}$ term for every ordered partition of 10 into a sum of eight powers of two. Up to order, there is only one such partition: $2^{1}+2^{1}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}+2^{0}$, which yields $\\frac{8 !}{6 ! \\cdot 2 !}=28$ ordered quadruples.\n\nTherefore the coefficient of $x^{10}$ is $2+10+28=\\mathbf{4 0}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To find the coefficient of \\(x^{10}\\) in \\(f(f(x))\\), we first need to understand the function \\(f(x)\\).
