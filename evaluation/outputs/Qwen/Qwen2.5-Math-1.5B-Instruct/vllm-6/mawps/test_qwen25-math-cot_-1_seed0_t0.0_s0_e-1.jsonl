The repeating decimal 0.08333333333333333 is equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\), and the repeating decimal 0.75 is equivalent to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nSo, we can rewrite the problem as:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 4 is 12.
