Calculate the fraction of students receiving honors who are Magna cumulative laude.\n4. Simplify the fraction if possible.\n\nFrom the table, we know:\n- The number of students who received Cum laude honors is 19.\n- The number of students who received Summa cumulative laude honors is 70.\n- The number of students who received Magna cumulative laude honors is 54.\n\nThe total number of students who received honors is the sum of the students who received Cum laude, Summa cumulative laude, and Magna cumulative laude honors. However, since the problem only asks for the fraction of students receiving honors who are Magna cumulative laude, we only need the number of students who are Magna cumulative laude and the total number of students who received honors.\n\nThe total number of students who received honors is:\n\\[ 19 + 70 + 54 = 143 \\]\n\nThe number of students who received honors and are Magna cumulative laude is 54.\n\nThe fraction of students receiving honors who are Magna cumulative laude is:\n\\[ \\frac{54}{143} \\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 54 and 143. The factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54, and the factors of 143 are 1, 11, 13, 143. The only common factor is 1, so the GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe simplified fraction is:\n\\[ \\frac{54}{143} \\]\n\nSo, the fraction of students receiving honors who are Magna cumulative laude is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{54}{143}} \\]"], "pred": ["\\frac{54}{143}"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

Calculate the total number of dogs registered with the city.\n2. Determine the fraction of Boxers out of the total number of dogs.\n3. Simplify the fraction.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of dogs registered with the city. We do this by summing the number of dogs in each breed category:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\text{ (Golden moment) } + 780 \\text{ (Boxers) } + 850 \\text{ (Beagles) } + 140 \\text{ (German Shepherds) } + 420 \\text{ (Other) }\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[\n1000 + 780 + 850 + 140 + 420 = 3190\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of dogs registered with the city is 3190.\n\nNext, we need to find the fraction of Boxers out of the total number of dogs. The number of Boxers is 780, so the fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{780}{3190}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 780 and 3190. Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. Divide 3190 by 780 and find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   3190 \\div 780 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 90\n   \\]\n   So, \\(3190 = 780 \\times 4 + 90\\).\n\n2. Now, divide 780 by 90:\n   \\[\n   780 \\div 90 = 8 \\text{ remainder } 60\n   \\]\n   So, \\(780 = 90 \\times 8 + 60\\).\n\n3. Next, divide 90 by 60:\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 60 = 1 \\text{ remainder } 30\n   \\]\n   So, \\(90 = 60 \\times 1 + 30\\).\n\n4. Then, divide 60 by 30:\n   \\[\n   60 \\div 30 = 2 \\text{ remainder } 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(60 = 30 \\times 2 + 0\\).\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 780 and 3190 is 10. We can now simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{780}{3190}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 10:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{780 \\div 10}{3190 \\div 10} = \\frac{78}{319}\n\\]\n\nThus, the fraction of dogs registered with the city that are Boxers, in its simplest form, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{78}{319}}\n\\]"], "pred": ["\\frac{78}{319}"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

Calculate the probability by dividing the number of customers who purchased a footlong shoe and are dis plane by the total number of customers who purchased hiking shoes.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The table provides the following data:\n- A Footlong shoe: 5 positive, 3 negative\n- A Toes knows shoe: 6 positive, 6 negative\n\nThe total number of customers who purchased hiking shoes is the sum of all customers from both shoe brands:\n\\[ 5 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we identify the number of customers who purchased a footlong shoe and are dis plane. According to the table, this number is 3.\n\nNow, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of customers who purchased a footlong shoe and are dis plane by the total number of customers who purchased hiking shoes:\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{3}{20} \\]\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected customer purchased a footlong shoe and is dis plane is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{20}}\\)."], "pred": ["\\frac{3}{20}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Calculate the probability by dividing the number of drivers with a blue car and red hair by the total number of drivers.\n\nFirst, let's identify the total number of drivers. From the table, we can see that there are two categories of drivers: those who drive red cars and those who drive blue cars. The total number of drivers is the sum of all the drivers in the table:\n\n\\[\n7 \\text{ (red car, red hair)} + 3 \\text{ (red car, blue hair)} + 3 \\text{ (blue car, red hair)} + 6 \\text{ (blue car, blue hair)} = 19\n\\]\n\nNext, we identify the number of drivers who have a blue car and red hair. From the table, we see that there are 3 drivers who have a blue car and red hair.\n\nNow, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of drivers with a blue car and red hair by the total number of drivers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of drivers with a blue car and red hair}}{\\text{Total number of drivers}} = \\frac{3}{19}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected driver has a blue car and has red hair is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{19}}\\)."], "pred": ["\\frac{3}{19}"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
