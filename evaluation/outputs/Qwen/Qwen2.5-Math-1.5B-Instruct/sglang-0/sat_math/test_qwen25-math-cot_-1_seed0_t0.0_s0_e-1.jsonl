Rana's sample contained more students who drank exactly seven soft drink servings than Michal's sample contained. This is not necessarily related to the margin of error. The margin of error is not directly dependent on the number of students who drank a specific number of soft drinks, but rather on the sample size.\n\nD. Rana's sample contained more students who drank exactly eight soft drink servings than Michal's sample contained. This is not necessarily related to the margin of error. The margin of error is not directly dependent on the number of students who drank a specific number of soft drinks, but rather on the sample size.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for why Rana obtained a smaller margin of error than Michal is that Rana's sample contained more students than Michal's sample contained.
